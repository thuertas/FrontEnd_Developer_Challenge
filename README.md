# FrontEnd_Developer_Challenge
## Identify the Problem/Opportunity(Innovation)
Your task is to redesign a few key pages of the Prepr Network. Reimagine and create frontend webpages of the following pages (and possible sub-pages): 
- Explore page (https://preprlabs.org/) 
- Projects page (https://preprlabs.org/myProjects) 
- Challenges page (https://preprlabs.org/list/challenge) 
- Challenge details page (https://preprlabs.org/challengeManager/front-end-developer-work-challenge) 
- Labs page (https://preprlabs.org/joinedLab).

## Show the Solution(Innovation)
The navigation menu of the page was divided into two separate menus to make it more effective: 
- The navigation in the header: 
-----Resources 
-----News Feed 
-----Organization 
----- Help 
- The Menu related to the user's account [displayed when hovering (large screens) and clicking (small and medium) the user-icon] 
-----Projects 
-----labs 
-----Challenges 
-----Achievements 
-----Inbox 
-----Settings 
-----Log out 

Additionally, each page was redesigned accordingly: 
**All the pages kept the same new style for consistency and better navigation 
### 1. HOMEPAGE 
Redesigned the Explore page to make it more dynamic, hence, you will first find a carousel that will display the latest/newest challenges. Bellow, the user will be able to find a list of challenges, labs and projects. These challenges, labs and projects will be displayed in a grid of "cards" that will contain different information about the respective challenge/lab/project. This grid will work with tabs that will help the user navigate between challenges, labs and projects. The grid was designed with the intention to provide more cards at the same time (for large and media screens) so that the user can navigate and compare the cards more easily. 
### 2. PROJECTS PAGE 
It now displays the projects in a grid. The user can again navigate between My projects and invited projects by using the tabs at the top. Also, the user will be able to access more information about those projects simply by clicking anywhere on the project cards. Moreover, this page now has a new button (Edit, next to the New project button) that will show additional buttons over the cards when it is clicked. This will enable the possibility to move and delete any of the projects listed. [the move and delete functionality was not implemented for the prototype but the delete and move buttons will show up when the edit button is clicked]. 
### 3. CHALLENGES PAGE: 
Here, the user will again be able to navigate using the tabs. Nevertheless, the filters will be now shown at the lefts side of the page (for large screens) and will smoothly move every time the user scrolls (sticky feature) so that they always have fast access to the filters and change the selection anytime. *This filters will only be shown in the Browse tab Also, the most popular categories were removed from the dropdown selector to avoid confusion and redundancy. 
### 4. CHALLENGE DETAILS PAGE: 
**This page can only be accessed by clicking the view more button in the challenge card 
This page was redesigned to provide more space to the text area and less to the image. This page has a slightly different style, compared to the others, because this one has three different sections: 
- First one: Displays the requirements, images and text information. 
This part also uses the "show more" anchor to display more information if the user clicks it. 
- Second one: Displays additional information, where the discussions, submissions and members will be located. This section will be collapsed and will only expand this information when the user clicks the respective tab. 
- Third one: This last section displays the information of the host of the challenge. 
**The additional information that was displayed on the original website was removed from this prototype with the goal of not overwhelming the user with information. However, if this information is strictly necessary it can be added in additional sections. 
### 5. LABS PAGE: 
This page is very similar to the Challenges page. This page also has the same order for the tabs (the Browse tab comes first) for consistency. 
### 6. NEW FEATURES (not mentioned above): 
- The footer 
- New icons for buttons 
- The search input was replaced by the magnifying glass in the header (for large screens) *The idea with this buttons is that when the user clicks it the search input field will be shown below the header 
- The search will be shown in the dropdown menu for small and medium screens. 
- The Favicon 
### 7. FEATURES THAT WERE KEPT FROM THE ORIGINAL: 
- The colour palette 
- The prepr logo 
- icons for the menu 
- The chat button at the bottom of the screen [in the prototype is a static image].
